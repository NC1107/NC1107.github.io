Welcome to my new blog! I recently rebuilt my portfolio site using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Why the Redesign?

I wanted to modernize my portfolio while keeping the aesthetic I liked - the nature photography background, the VT323 monospace font, and the earthy color palette. The old site was pure HTML/CSS/JS, which worked but wasn't easy to maintain.

## What's New

- **Component-based architecture** - No more duplicating the navbar across every page
- **TypeScript** - Better developer experience with type checking
- **Blog support** - You're reading it right now!
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automatic deployments on every push

## What's Next

I plan to write about:

- My homelab setup and self-hosting journey
- Rust experiments and systems programming
- AWS and infrastructure work
- Interesting side projects

Stay tuned!
